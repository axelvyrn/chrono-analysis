# Genesis Chronofield Equations

1. Let

$$
\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)
$$

be the chronal potential which affects how fast clocks tick.

2. If we define *time passage* (local proper time) as

$$
\frac{dt}{dx} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)}{c^2}}
$$

then inspired by GR’s Schwarzschild metric:

$$
d\tau = dt \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)}{c^2}}
$$

This is another probable interpretation of time change and local proper time.

## Upgrade to my proposed formula

I initially thought, that a time change (local to an observer)

$$\Delta t = \phi_t \cdot |(\vec{T} \times \vec{p})|$$

where,

$$\phi_t$$ = chronal potential, a scalar field indicating the intensity of time at a point

$$\vec{T}$$ = Chronal direction vector (direction of "temporal flow")

$$\vec{p}$$ = Momentum vector since time seems to be influenced my both mass and velocity

$$\vec{T} \times \vec{p}$$ = A vector perpendicular to both — akin to an induced "chronal torque"?

I'm trying to put forward the fact that a change in time is induced by a change in both the interaction of the body with the Time vector and its potential (a moving mass)

Here $$\phi_t$$ (chronal potential) is a relative scalar quantity that differs from material to material,
I want to imply that where $$\phi_t$$ is greater, it means the mass is dense or very fast and thus time dilates and is slower with respect to it. And if there is a gradient of $$\phi_t$$, we get a chronal vector $$\vec{C} = -\nabla\phi_t$$
So then we get, 

$$\Delta t = (-\nabla\phi_t) \cdot |(\vec{T} \times \vec{p})|$$

Which links directly to massive objects altering time flow and that **an object parallel to the flow of time would not experience it**.
The required unit of chronal potential $$\phi_t$$ would be $$\frac{s}{kg \cdot m}$$

If we accept these units for the chronal potential, it means:

Chronal potential is a measure of how time flows per unit of momentum-space displacement.

It inversely scales with mass and position, implying heavier or faster-moving objects dampen the local time flow (sounds heretical to Minkowski and Schwarzschild metrics)

Let chronal field vector 

$$\vec{C} = -\nabla\phi_t$$

so it becomes

$$\Delta t = \vec{C} \cdot |(\vec{T} \times \vec{p})|$$

so maybe,

## Possible Experimental Setup

A Gedankenexperiment (thought experiment) or basis for simulation:

> Place ultra-sensitive atomic clocks on supercooled superconducting gyroscopes that rotate in strong magnetic or gravitational fields. If a time-field exists and interacts with angular momentum, there might be a deviation in the clock rate not predicted by GR alone.

Then I will be able to compare $$\Delta t$$ not just by altitude (GR) or speed (SR), but by orientation and momentum direction in relation to a hypothesized temporal field.

## Final Notes
My progress beyond this limit requires additional knowledge of advance quantum concepts, tensors, operators (specifically Lagrangian and Hamiltonian) both to proceed with mathematical proofs as well as experiments to prove where I was wrong myself. This project will be updated accordingly.
