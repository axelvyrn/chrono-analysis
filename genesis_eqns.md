# Genesis Chronofield Equations

1. Let

$$
\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)
$$

be the chronal potential which affects how fast clocks tick.

2. If we define *time passage* (local proper time) as

$$
\frac{dt}{dx} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)}{c^2}}
$$
then inspired by GRâ€™s Schwarzschild metric:
$$
dt = dt \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}} \implies \sqrt{1 + \frac{2\phi_t(\vec{r}, t)}{c^2}}
$$

## Possible Experimental Setup

A Gedankenexperiment (thought experiment) or basis for simulation:

> Place ultra-sensitive atomic clocks on supercooled superconducting gyroscopes that rotate in strong magnetic or gravitational fields. If a time-field exists and interacts with angular momentum, there might be a deviation in the clock rate not predicted by GR alone.

Then I will be able to compare $$\Delta t$$ not just by altitude (GR) or speed (SR), but by orientation and momentum direction in relation to a hypothesized temporal field.
