# My Stand in this theory

Einstein in Special and General Relativity:

- Time is a fourth dimension — like space, but with a minus sign in the metric: $$ds² = -c²dt² + dx² + dy² + dz²$$.
- Time dilation occurs due to motion (SR) or gravity (GR), and simultaneity is relative.
- In GR, spacetime is a fabric, warped by mass-energy. Time isn’t “flowing,” it just is — the universe is “block-like,” static, with all moments existing simultaneously and predefined.

This is the Block Universe view.
I am not disproving his view, I am trying to reframe the concept. I see his road as the wind and while he measured distances along it, I'm trying to measure its force.

If time is a field, then time reversal means flipping the field vector.
Like a magnetic polarity flip.
Maybe due to exotic matter or topological defects?

Or: reversing motion against the chronal vector.
I find that time reversal isn’t moving backward on a timeline, but resisting the chronal pressure — like swimming up a river of entropy.

Possibilities of how time was built/created and then flows through the entire universe:

- The Big Bang singularity as the chronal core.
- A quantum vacuum symmetry-breaking event.
- A hidden temporal dimension curled up like Calabi–Yau shapes in string theory.

Or maybe the field is recreated constantly like Hawking radiation — every Planck instant regenerating time from our or a body's actions, like I theorised in the initial document.

If time is a field then reversal happens when $$vec{T}$$ flips direction. This could happen in local regions with negative chronal charge or potential, akin to antimatter interaction with time.
Perception of reversal: If another observer lies in an opposing chronal gradient, their causality vector flips — their “future” events lie in our “past” and vice versa!

# Experiments to support my ground:

### 1. Gravitational Time Dilation in Earth's Field (Hafele–Keating Experiment - 1971)
In 1971, Hafele and Keating flew atomic clocks around the world on commercial airliners. When compared to the stationary clock at the U.S. Naval Observatory:
- Clocks flying eastward (with Earth's rotation) lost time.
- Clocks flying westward gained time.

This matched the predictions of both gravitational and velocity-based time dilation. This implies that "something" about the Earth's mass and/or rotation changes the flow of time. Mainstream science attributes this to spacetime curvature. But what if...the gravitational field is just a low-resolution perception of a deeper “time field” gradient — not curvature of space, but of causality.

This gives rise to key questions, which I would like to progress with further,
- Can this "chronal field" be mapped via varying gravitational potentials?
- Is the field scalar or vectorial? Does it have flux?
- Could we define a new equation analogous to Maxwell's equations, for chronal flow?

### 2. The Shapiro Time Delay (1964)

Irwin Shapiro proposed that light traveling near a massive object (like the Sun) takes longer to reach us than expected — not just because it's a curved path, but because time itself is "slowed" in that region.

This was observed by bouncing radar signals off Venus and measuring how long they took to return, depending on their proximity to the Sun’s mass.

This shows that time isn’t just a uniform parameter of change, but a dynamic, position-dependent variable. And critically, the delay has nothing to do with the speed of light changing. It’s the “rate of time itself” that is distorted, which puts forward the possibility of a "chronal potential" field.

### 3. Gravitational Redshift of Light (Pound–Rebka Experiment, 1959)

Physicists Pound and Rebka measured the redshift of gamma rays sent vertically upward in Earth's gravity over a height of just 22.5 meters inside Harvard's Jefferson Tower.
Photons lost energy when traveling upward. The frequency was redshifted even though neither speed was lost nor medium was crossed.
Light shouldn't lose energy in a vacuum over 22.5 meters.

But it does, because:

> ❝ The higher up in a gravitational field, the “faster” time ticks. ❞

So, to match the faster ticking clocks higher up, the photons stretch their frequency. This only makes sense if time is a scalar field whose potential affects frequency.

# Chronal Field Interpretation

Just like electric potential affects a charge (via force), and gravitational potential affects mass:

A chronal potential $$\phi_t$$ affects clocks and photons (from eqn. in initial [theory](theory_stub.md)) — where

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \frac{\Delta\phi_t}{c^2}
$$

This is literally the form of the gravitational redshift equation, but instead of interpreting $$\phi_t$$ as gravitational potential only, we interpret it as a chronal field — the field of time rate variations.

In fact, the redshift formula:

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \frac{g \Delta h}{c^2}
$$

…is a field gradient expression:

$$
\frac{\Delta f}{f} = \frac{\Delta\phi_t}{c^2}
$$

This is identical to an electrostatic potential difference causing a field force on a particle.
Thus, in 

$$
\Delta t = \phi_t \cdot |(\vec{T} \times \vec{p})|
$$

The cross product indicates that $$\Delta t$$ is zero if momentum is parallel to the time field. This suggests that temporal distortion is greatest when motion is perpendicular to the temporal flux.

If $$\phi_t$$ is a scalar chronal potential, it scales the whole vector product — just like charge q in electromagnetism.
