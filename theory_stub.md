# Theory of Time — A Chronophysics Model (Thought Experiment)

## 1. Existence of Time

### Premises:

- Time is currently measured in seconds — a man-made unit. So lets start with contradictions, either:
  - Time does **not** exist and we’re measuring a *non-entity*, or
  - Time **does** exist and our unit is merely a convention.

### Argument:

- If time didn’t exist:
  - There would be no **intervals**.
  - Events would be simultaneous or indistinct or may even overlap due to lack of sequence or a proper ordering system
  - Time would not be conserved since it is symmetrical (Noether's Theorem)
- But we observe **intervals** and **causal ordering**, so time must exist.

### Conclusion:

Time is not a construct of human thought alone; it is an existential property of the universe or (maybe) a very funamental form of matter.

## 2. Is Time Visible? Then What *Is* It?

If something exists but cannot be directly observed, then it must be:

- A **field**, like magnetism.
- A **wave**, like light.
- A **force**, like gravity.
- Or a **substrate**, like spacetime.

But time seems to affect:

- **Events** — they are sequenced.
- **Processes** — they decay or grow.
- **Awareness** — memory, prediction, perception.

Yet we don’t “see” time, we see **change**. So what is causing the change? I thought of following possibilities:

## 3. Time as a Wave

### Premise:

- If time is a wave:
  - It must propagate through a **medium**.
  - That medium is likely **invisible** to our sensory system, maybe something so fundamental like gravity, that we are hardwired to ignore it. Like the nose in front of our eyes.

### Hypothesis:

- Perhaps it interacts with unknown **subatomic particles** (let’s call them *chronons*).
- These trigger our perception of flow — much like photons trigger vision.

---

## 4. Time as a Force (or Pseudo-force or Reactionary force)

### Analogy:

- **Centrifugal force** is a *pseudo* force - not real but perceived due to non-intertial frame of reference.

Could time be similar?

- Not a “push” or “pull” but a **reaction** to existing in it or due to something doing in it?

### Thought:

- Maybe we need a new **unit** to measure the *intensity of time flow* — like without **temperature** you cannot measure heat flow and direction.
- Current measurement (seconds) only tells *how long*, not *how strongly* time is being felt.

## 5. The Time Field & Chronal Potential (Time Field Theory)

If time is a force, then:

- There exists a **time field**.
- Just like gravity has **gravitational potential**, time has **chronal potential**.
- Thus time must be triggered by some very dense mass, maybe at the center of the universe that radiates the field outward and it extends without any obstruction over the entire spacetime fabric
- This gives rise to the implication that there might be places where time does *not* exist, like maybe the underside of the universe (lol) or the inside the body where time is created, like charge inside a hollow uniform charged body, even the Schwarzschild metric defines an event horizon, a point of no return for time (the Schwarzschild radius).

Black holes warp spacetime — so:

- Time must get “denser” or “more existential” around **massive** or **energetic** objects (proved by GR).

Let:

- $$\vec{T}\$$ : Time field vector
- $$\phi_t\$$ : Chronal potential (characteristic potential that differs based on material)
- $$\vec{p}\$$ : Observer's momentum vector

Then:
$$\Delta t = \phi_t \cdot (\vec{T} \times \vec{p})\$$

**Interpretation:**
The flow of experienced time $$\Delta t\$$ is a product of the local chronal potential and the cross product of the time field and the observer’s momentum. This implies a perpendicular interaction — similar to electromagnetic forces — where direction and motion shape the experienced passage of time.

## 6. Timeline as a Closed Loop

Let’s suppose:

- Time is not a line but a **closed timelike curve**.
- We travel along this curve — never seeing the full circle, only a tangent, this $$dt/dx$$ of the time loop is the the span of time we are allowed to see in our lifetime.

Now imagine:

- An observer traveling in the **opposite** direction.
- Their future becomes our past, and vice versa.
- Or maybe time is something in the making, it is created and it creates based on our actions and their implications.

## 7. Time as an Infinite Plane

### Premise:

- Most forces weaken with distance but time doesn’t “thin out”.

So maybe:

- Time is **perfectly ideal**, like a **mathematical plane,** because ideally, *how can you make time impure?*
- Time can exist like an **electric field of an infinite sheet**($\frac{Q}{2\epsilon_0}$), its effect is **uniform** and **undiminished** in local space.

This also explains:

- Why time is so *pure*: it cannot be corrupted, only experienced.

---

## Conclusion:

Time may not be a singular concept. It could be:

- A **wave**, propagating chronons.
- A **field**, with direction and density.
- A **force**, with reaction and resistance.
- A **topology**, closed yet unbounded.
- A **plane**, uniform and eternal.

Understanding time may require us to:

- Invent new particles (Chronons?)
- Define new units (Chronal intensity?)
- Accept new geometries (Closed-loop vs Infinite plane?)

My further objective is to weed out improbable theories out of these, work on existing ones as well probable ones in this theory and lift the veil.
