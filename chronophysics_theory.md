# Theory of Time — A Chronophysics Model

## 1. Existence of Time

### Premises:

- Time is currently measured in seconds — a man-made unit. So either:
  - Time does **not** exist and we’re measuring a *non-entity*, or
  - Time **does** exist and our unit is merely a convention.

### Argument:

- If time didn’t exist:
  - There would be no **intervals**.
  - Events would be simultaneous or indistinct or may even overlap due to lack of sequence or a proper ordering system
  - Time would not be conserved since it is symmetrical (Noether's Theorem)
- But we observe **intervals** and **causal ordering**, so time must exist.

### Conclusion:

Time is not a construct of human thought alone; it is an existential property of the universe, a very funamental form of matter.

## 2. Is Time Visible? Then What *Is* It?

If something exists but is not directly observable, it must be:

- A **field**, like magnetism.
- A **wave**, like light.
- A **force**, like gravity.
- Or a **substrate**, like spacetime.

Time seems to affect:

- **Events** — they are sequenced.
- **Processes** — they decay or grow.
- **Awareness** — memory, prediction, perception.

Yet we don’t “see” time — we see **change**. So what is causing the change? I thought of following 3 possibilities.

## 3. Time as a Wave

### Premise:

- If time is a wave:
  - It must propagate through a **medium**.
  - That medium is likely **invisible** to our sensory system.

### Hypothesis:

- Perhaps it interacts with unknown **subatomic particles** (let’s call them *chronons*).
- These trigger our perception of flow — much like photons trigger vision.

## 4. Time as a Force (or Pseudo-force)

### Analogy:

- **Centrifugal force** is a *reactionary* force — not real but perceived due to frame of reference.

Could time be similar?

- Not a “push” or “pull” but a **reaction** to existing in a field.

### Thought:

- Maybe we need a new **unit** to measure the *intensity of time flow* — like **temperature** for heat.
- Current measurement (seconds) only tells *how long*, not *how strongly* time is being felt.

## 5. The Time Field & Chronal Potential (Time Waterfall Theory)

If time is a force, then:

- There exists a **time field**.
- Just like gravity has **gravitational potential**, time has **chronal potential**.
- Maybe this field is not a regular field and falls like a waterfall and spreads over the universe, higher over rocks/stones like planets, galaxies depending on their high chronal potential and flowing smoothly over lower ones with less bumps, combine it with 7 and it might not diminish with distance.

Black holes warp spacetime — so:

- Time must get “denser” or “more existential” around **massive** or **energetic** objects.

> “Time drips slower where reality is heavy.”

Let:

- \(\vec{T}\): Time field vector
- \(\phi_t\): Chronal potential (characteristic potential that differs based on material)
- \(\vec{p}\): Observer's momentum vector

Then:
\(\Delta t = \phi_t \cdot (\vec{T} \times \vec{p})\)

**Interpretation:**
The flow of experienced time (\(\Delta t\)) is a product of the local chronal potential and the cross product of the time field and the observer’s momentum. This implies a perpendicular interaction — similar to electromagnetic forces — where direction and motion shape the experienced passage of time.

## 6. Timeline as a Closed Loop

Let’s suppose:

- Time is not a line but a **closed timelike curve**.
- We travel along this curve — never seeing the full circle, only a tangent.

Now imagine:

- An observer traveling in the **opposite** direction.
- Their future becomes our past, and vice versa.
- Or maybe time is something in the making, it is created and it creates based on our actions and their implications

> Time is the carousel. We’re just facing one direction.

## 7. Time as an Infinite Plane

### Premise:

- Most forces weaken with distance — but time doesn’t “thin out”.

So maybe:

- Time is **perfectly ideal**, like a **mathematical plane,** because ideally, *how can you make time impure?*
- Time can exist like an **electric field of an infinite sheet**, its effect is **uniform** and **undiminished** in local space.

This also explains:

- Why time is so *pure*: it cannot be corrupted, only experienced.

> “Time doesn’t dilute. It discloses.”

## Conclusion:

Time may not be a singular concept. It could be:

- A **wave**, propagating chronons.
- A **field**, with direction and density.
- A **force**, with reaction and resistance.
- A **topology**, closed yet unbounded.
- A **plane**, uniform and eternal.

Understanding time may require us to:

- Invent new particles (Chronons?)
- Define new units (Chronal intensity?)
- Accept new geometries (Closed-loop vs Infinite plane?)
