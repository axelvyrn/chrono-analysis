# Abstract:

This theory explores a new way of understanding time — not as just something we measure with clocks, but as a force or wave-like field that flows through the universe. The key idea is that time isn't separate from space or matter, but deeply connected to both.

Just like gravity affects how objects move, this theory proposes a "time field" that influences how living beings and particles experience time. The strength of this field — called chronal potential — could vary depending on mass, motion, or position in space (for example, near a black hole).

In the latest update, time is described using an equation:
$$\Delta t_{observer} = \phi_t \cdot (\vec{T} \times \vec{p})$$

This means:

The passage of time you feel ($$\Delta t$$) depends on how your momentum ($$\vec{p}$$) interacts with the direction of the time field ($$\vec{T}$$), and the strength of time at your location (chronal potential ($$\phi_t$$))

The theory also explores whether time is a force, a wave, or an infinite field, and considers if it's something that can curve, loop, or carry us through it — like a river we don't yet see, but one we’re all flowing through.
